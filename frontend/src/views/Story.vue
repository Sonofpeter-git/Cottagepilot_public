          For years, every summer and weekend getaway to the cottage felt like a mix of joy and hidden stress.

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
          I loved the peace of the forest, the sound of birds, and the crackling fireplace — but there was always that nagging feeling at the back of my mind.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
          Was the sauna heater turned off? Did we remember to check the water supply? Had the fridge been running all winter? And what about those little chores — bringing firewood, cleaning the gutters, checking the boat? Somehow, despite all my best intentions, things slipped through the cracks.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
          I tried notebooks, sticky notes, and group chats, but nothing really helped. Plans got lost, tasks forgotten, and every visit started with a scramble to remember what needed doing. The joy of the cottage was often overshadowed by the anxiety of managing it.

            That's when I realized — why isn't there a simple, smart tool to bring all this together?
          </p>
          <p class="text-center">
            A place where I could organize tasks, share notes with family, keep a calendar, and even connect sensors to monitor the cottage remotely?

          It's designed to take the stress out of cottage living by helping you plan, remember, and monitor everything in one place — so you can focus on what really matters: relaxing, making memories, and enjoying your home away from home.
